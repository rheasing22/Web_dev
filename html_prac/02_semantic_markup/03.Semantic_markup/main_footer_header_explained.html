        <h2>Introduction</h2>

        <p>
          The cat (Felis catus) is a domestic species of small carnivorous
          mammal.[1][2] It is the only domesticated species in the family
          Felidae and is often referred to as the domestic cat to distinguish it
          from the wild members of the family. A cat can either be a house cat,
          a farm cat or a feral cat; the latter ranges freely and avoids human
          contact. Domestic cats are valued by humans for companionship and
          their ability to hunt rodents. About 60 cat breeds are recognized by
          various cat registries.

          The cat is similar in anatomy to the other felid species: it has a
          strong flexible body, quick reflexes, sharp teeth and retractable
          claws adapted to killing small prey. Its night vision and sense of
          smell are well developed. Cat communication includes vocalizations
          like meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling and grunting as
          well as cat-specific body language. A predator that is most active at
          dawn and dusk, the cat is a solitary hunter but a social species. It
          can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears,
          such as those made by mice and other small mammals. [7] It secretes
          and perceives pheromones.[8]
